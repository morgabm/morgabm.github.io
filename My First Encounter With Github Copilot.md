What is a good approach to VkPhysicalDevice selection

#
**GitHub Copilot**

The selection of a `VkPhysicalDevice` in a Vulkan application is a crucial step as it represents the GPU that will be used for rendering. The selection process typically involves the following steps:

1. Enumerate the physical devices available on the system using `vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices`.
2. For each physical device, check if it supports the features your application needs. This can include checking the type of the device (discrete GPU, integrated GPU, etc.), checking if it supports the required Vulkan version, checking if it supports the required Vulkan extensions, and checking if it has enough memory and compute units for your needs.
3. Score each device based on your application's specific needs. For example, you might prefer a discrete GPU over an integrated one, or a device that supports a higher Vulkan version, or a device with more memory, etc.
4. Select the device with the highest score.

Here is a basic example of how you can implement this in C++:

```cpp
VkPhysicalDevice selectPhysicalDevice(VkInstance instance) {
    uint32_t deviceCount = 0;
    vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(instance, &deviceCount, nullptr);

    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("failed to find GPUs with Vulkan support!");
    }

    std::vector<VkPhysicalDevice> devices(deviceCount);
    vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(instance, &deviceCount, devices.data());

    std::multimap<int, VkPhysicalDevice> candidates;

    for (const auto& device : devices) {
        int score = scoreDevice(device);
        candidates.insert(std::make_pair(score, device));
    }

    // Check if the best candidate is suitable at all
    if (candidates.rbegin()->first > 0) {
        return candidates.rbegin()->second;
    } else {
        throw std::runtime_error("failed to find a suitable GPU!");
    }
}
```

In this code, `scoreDevice` is a function that calculates a score for a device based on your application's specific needs. You can modify this function to suit your needs.

#

Can you design a composable functional approach to scoreDevice for me? An acceptable solution should allow for multiple implementations of a scoreDevice algorithm which are composable onto each other.

#
**GitHub Copilot**

Sure, a composable functional approach to `scoreDevice` can be achieved by creating a series of scoring functions that each handle a specific aspect of the scoring. These functions can then be composed together to create the final scoring function. Here's a basic example in C++:

First, define a type for your scoring functions. These functions should take a `VkPhysicalDevice` and return an `int`:

```cpp
using ScoringFunction = std::function<int(VkPhysicalDevice)>;
```

Next, define your individual scoring functions. For example, you might have one function for scoring based on the device type, and another for scoring based on whether the device supports a geometry shader:

```cpp
ScoringFunction scoreDeviceType = [](VkPhysicalDevice device) {
    VkPhysicalDeviceProperties properties;
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties(device, &properties);

    if (properties.deviceType == VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_DISCRETE_GPU) {
        return 1000;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
};

ScoringFunction scoreGeometryShader = [](VkPhysicalDevice device) {
    VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures features;
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures(device, &features);

    if (features.geometryShader) {
        return 500;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
};
```

Finally, you can create a function to compose these scoring functions together. This function takes a list of scoring functions and returns a new scoring function that sums the scores from each individual function:

```cpp
ScoringFunction composeScoringFunctions(const std::vector<ScoringFunction>& functions) {
    return [functions](VkPhysicalDevice device) {
        int totalScore = 0;
        for (const auto& function : functions) {
            totalScore += function(device);
        }
        return totalScore;
    };
}
```

You can now create a `scoreDevice` function by composing the individual scoring functions:

```cpp
ScoringFunction scoreDevice = composeScoringFunctions({scoreDeviceType, scoreGeometryShader});
```

This `scoreDevice` function can now be used in the same way as your original `scoreDevice` function, but it has the advantage of being composed of smaller, simpler functions that can be tested and modified independently.

#
**Me**

This looks good, but what if I did not want to use lambdas?

#
**GitHub Copilot**

If you prefer not to use lambdas, you can define the scoring functions as regular functions or as methods in a class. Here's an example of how you can do this:

First, define the type for your scoring functions:

```cpp
using ScoringFunction = int(*)(VkPhysicalDevice);
```

Next, define your individual scoring functions as regular functions:

```cpp
int scoreDeviceType(VkPhysicalDevice device) {
    VkPhysicalDeviceProperties properties;
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties(device, &properties);

    if (properties.deviceType == VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_DISCRETE_GPU) {
        return 1000;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}

int scoreGeometryShader(VkPhysicalDevice device) {
    VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures features;
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures(device, &features);

    if (features.geometryShader) {
        return 500;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Then, create a function to compose these scoring functions together:

```cpp
ScoringFunction composeScoringFunctions(const std::vector<ScoringFunction>& functions) {
    return [functions](VkPhysicalDevice device) {
        int totalScore = 0;
        for (const auto& function : functions) {
            totalScore += function(device);
        }
        return totalScore;
    };
}
```

Finally, create a `scoreDevice` function by composing the individual scoring functions:

```cpp
ScoringFunction scoreDevice = composeScoringFunctions({scoreDeviceType, scoreGeometryShader});
```

This `scoreDevice` function can now be used in the same way as your original `scoreDevice` function, but it has the advantage of being composed of smaller, simpler functions that can be tested and modified independently.

#
**Me**

is there a generic variety of this compose function we have created that is available in the STL?

#
**GitHub Copilot**

Yes, there is a generic way to compose functions in C++ using the STL, but it's not as straightforward as having a single function that does it. You can use `std::bind` and `std::function` to create a composition of functions. However, this doesn't work as cleanly as the custom compose function we created earlier, especially when you want to compose multiple functions together.

Here's an example of how you can use `std::bind` and `std::function` to compose two functions together:

```cpp
#include <functional>

int scoreDeviceType(VkPhysicalDevice device) {
    // scoring logic here
}

int scoreGeometryShader(VkPhysicalDevice device) {
    // scoring logic here
}

std::function<int(VkPhysicalDevice)> compose(std::function<int(VkPhysicalDevice)> f, std::function<int(VkPhysicalDevice)> g) {
    return [=](VkPhysicalDevice device) { return f(device) + g(device); };
}

int main() {
    auto scoreDevice = compose(scoreDeviceType, scoreGeometryShader);
    // Now you can use scoreDevice as a composed function
}
```

This will work for composing two functions, but if you want to compose more than two, you would need to nest calls to `compose`, which can get messy.

In C++20, there's a proposal for `std::compose` which would make function composition as easy as it is in functional programming languages, but it's not yet part of the standard library.

#
**Me**

You mentioned std::bind in your last example, but I do not see it being used anywhere.

#
**GitHub Copilot**

I apologize for the confusion. You're correct, the example provided did not use `std::bind`. It was a mistake in the explanation. The `std::bind` function is used to bind one or more arguments to a function, and it returns a function object that can be called later. However, in the context of composing functions, `std::bind` is not typically used. Instead, function composition in C++ is often achieved through the use of lambdas, as shown in the previous examples.

#
**Me**

could we extend our new compose method by using templates, so that it may compose other types of functions together?

#
**GitHub Copilot**

Yes, you can use templates to create a more generic compose function that can handle different types of functions. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```cpp
template<typename Func>
auto compose(Func f) {
    return [f](auto... args) { return f(args...); };
}

template<typename Func1, typename Func2, typename... Funcs>
auto compose(Func1 f1, Func2 f2, Funcs... funcs) {
    return [f1, f2, funcs...](auto... args) {
        return f1(compose(f2, funcs...)(args...));
    };
}
```

In this code, the first `compose` function is a base case that simply returns the function `f`. The second `compose` function is a variadic template that takes at least two functions. It creates a lambda that calls the first function with the result of the composition of the rest of the functions.

This `compose` function can be used to compose functions of different types together. For example:

```cpp
auto addOne = [](int x) { return x + 1; };
auto multiplyByTwo = [](int x) { return x * 2; };
auto subtractThree = [](int x) { return x - 3; };

auto composedFunction = compose(addOne, multiplyByTwo, subtractThree);

int result = composedFunction(5);  // result is 5
```

In this example, `composedFunction` is a function that first subtracts 3 from its argument, then multiplies the result by 2, and finally adds 1.

#
**Me**

I very much like this last solution, can you now apply it to our device selection use case with examples?

#
**GitHub Copilot**

Sure, let's apply the generic compose function to the `scoreDevice` function in your Vulkan application. 

First, we'll need to modify the `scoreDevice` function to be a composition of smaller scoring functions. We'll create two scoring functions: `scoreDeviceType` and `scoreGeometryShader`. 

```cpp
int scoreDeviceType(VkPhysicalDevice device) {
    VkPhysicalDeviceProperties properties;
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties(device, &properties);

    if (properties.deviceType == VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_DISCRETE_GPU) {
        return 1000;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}

int scoreGeometryShader(VkPhysicalDevice device) {
    VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures features;
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures(device, &features);

    if (features.geometryShader) {
        return 500;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Next, we'll define the generic compose function using templates:

```cpp
template<typename Func>
auto compose(Func f) {
    return [f](auto... args) { return f(args...); };
}

template<typename Func1, typename Func2, typename... Funcs>
auto compose(Func1 f1, Func2 f2, Funcs... funcs) {
    return [f1, f2, funcs...](auto... args) {
        return f1(compose(f2, funcs...)(args...));
    };
}
```

Now, we can create a `scoreDevice` function by composing the individual scoring functions:

```cpp
auto scoreDevice = compose(scoreDeviceType, scoreGeometryShader);
```

Finally, we'll need to modify the `selectPhysicalDevice` function to use the new `scoreDevice` function:

```cpp
VkPhysicalDevice selectPhysicalDevice(VkInstance instance) {
    uint32_t deviceCount = 0;
    vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(instance, &deviceCount, nullptr);

    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("failed to find GPUs with Vulkan support!");
    }

    std::vector<VkPhysicalDevice> devices(deviceCount);
    vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(instance, &deviceCount, devices.data());

    std::multimap<int, VkPhysicalDevice> candidates;

    for (const auto& device : devices) {
        int score = scoreDevice(device);
        candidates.insert(std::make_pair(score, device));
    }

    // Check if the best candidate is suitable at all
    if (candidates.rbegin()->first > 0) {
        return candidates.rbegin()->second;
    } else {
        throw std::runtime_error("failed to find a suitable GPU!");
    }
}
```

This `scoreDevice` function can now be used in the same way as your original `scoreDevice` function, but it has the advantage of being composed of smaller, simpler functions that can be tested and modified independently.

#
**Me**

Awesome, this is almost perfect, but one last thing. Could you modify the selectPhysicalDevice method to be passed a scoreDevice method instead of using a top level defined method. Then, summarize our entire final solution for me.

#
**GitHub Copilot**

Sure, we can modify the `selectPhysicalDevice` method to accept a scoring function as a parameter. This will make the function more flexible and allow you to use different scoring functions if needed. Here's how you can do it:

```cpp
VkPhysicalDevice selectPhysicalDevice(VkInstance instance, std::function<int(VkPhysicalDevice)> scoreDevice) {
    uint32_t deviceCount = 0;
    vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(instance, &deviceCount, nullptr);

    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("failed to find GPUs with Vulkan support!");
    }

    std::vector<VkPhysicalDevice> devices(deviceCount);
    vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(instance, &deviceCount, devices.data());

    std::multimap<int, VkPhysicalDevice> candidates;

    for (const auto& device : devices) {
        int score = scoreDevice(device);
        candidates.insert(std::make_pair(score, device));
    }

    // Check if the best candidate is suitable at all
    if (candidates.rbegin()->first > 0) {
        return candidates.rbegin()->second;
    } else {
        throw std::runtime_error("failed to find a suitable GPU!");
    }
}
```

Now, you can pass the `scoreDevice` function when calling `selectPhysicalDevice`:

```cpp
auto scoreDevice = compose(scoreDeviceType, scoreGeometryShader);
auto physicalDevice = selectPhysicalDevice(instance, scoreDevice);
```

To summarize, we have created a more flexible and modular solution for scoring and selecting a physical device in a Vulkan application. We have defined individual scoring functions (`scoreDeviceType` and `scoreGeometryShader`), and a generic `compose` function that can combine these scoring functions into a single function. We then pass this composed function to the `selectPhysicalDevice` function, which uses it to score and select the best physical device. This approach allows for easier testing and modification of the scoring logic, as each scoring function is independent and the composition is done dynamically at runtime.

#
**Me**

My apologies, summarize was the incorrect word, could you show me the entire final code with multiple usage examples?

#
**GitHub Copilot**

Sure, here is the final code with the changes we discussed:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <optional>
#include <vector>
#include <vulkan/vulkan.h>
#include <functional>

int scoreDeviceType(VkPhysicalDevice device) {
    VkPhysicalDeviceProperties properties;
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties(device, &properties);

    if (properties.deviceType == VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_DISCRETE_GPU) {
        return 1000;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}

int scoreGeometryShader(VkPhysicalDevice device) {
    VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures features;
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures(device, &features);

    if (features.geometryShader) {
        return 500;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}

template<typename Func>
auto compose(Func f) {
    return [f](auto... args) { return f(args...); };
}

template<typename Func1, typename Func2, typename... Funcs>
auto compose(Func1 f1, Func2 f2, Funcs... funcs) {
    return [f1, f2, funcs...](auto... args) {
        return f1(compose(f2, funcs...)(args...));
    };
}

VkPhysicalDevice selectPhysicalDevice(VkInstance instance, std::function<int(VkPhysicalDevice)> scoreDevice) {
    uint32_t deviceCount = 0;
    vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(instance, &deviceCount, nullptr);

    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("failed to find GPUs with Vulkan support!");
    }

    std::vector<VkPhysicalDevice> devices(deviceCount);
    vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(instance, &deviceCount, devices.data());

    std::multimap<int, VkPhysicalDevice> candidates;

    for (const auto& device : devices) {
        int score = scoreDevice(device);
        candidates.insert(std::make_pair(score, device));
    }

    // Check if the best candidate is suitable at all
    if (candidates.rbegin()->first > 0) {
        return candidates.rbegin()->second;
    } else {
        throw std::runtime_error("failed to find a suitable GPU!");
    }
}

int main() {
    VkInstance instance = createInstance(); // Assuming createInstance() is defined elsewhere

    auto scoreDevice = compose(scoreDeviceType, scoreGeometryShader);
    VkPhysicalDevice physicalDevice = selectPhysicalDevice(instance, scoreDevice);

    // You can also create different scoring functions and use them
    auto scoreDevice2 = compose([](VkPhysicalDevice device) { /* scoring logic */ }, scoreGeometryShader);
    VkPhysicalDevice physicalDevice2 = selectPhysicalDevice(instance, scoreDevice2);
}
```

In this code, we first define the individual scoring functions `scoreDeviceType` and `scoreGeometryShader`. We then define a generic `compose` function that can combine these scoring functions into a single function. The `selectPhysicalDevice` function is modified to accept a scoring function as a parameter. In the `main` function, we create a `scoreDevice` function by composing `scoreDeviceType` and `scoreGeometryShader`, and pass this function to `selectPhysicalDevice` to select the best physical device. We also show an example of creating a different scoring function and using it to select a physical device.

#
**Me**

This looks great, but looking at the code it is not clear to me if our compose implementation is suming the return values of the composed methods as I would expect. Additionally, it seems like there is no way for one of the composed methods to short circuit the entire thing if it comes across a requirement that can not be satisfied. Would you agree with my assesment?

#
**GitHub Copilot**

Yes, you are correct in your assessment. The current implementation of the `compose` function does not sum the return values of the composed functions. Instead, it passes the return value of one function as the argument to the next function. This is a common pattern in function composition, but it may not be what you want in this case.

Additionally, you are correct that the current implementation does not provide a way for one of the composed functions to short-circuit the entire process. If one of the functions returns a value that indicates a requirement is not satisfied, the other functions will still be called.

If you want the `compose` function to sum the return values of the composed functions and to stop evaluating as soon as one of the functions returns a value that indicates a requirement is not satisfied, you would need to modify the `compose` function. Here's an example of how you could do this:

```cpp
template<typename Func>
auto compose(Func f) {
    return [f](auto... args) { return f(args...); };
}

template<typename Func1, typename Func2, typename... Funcs>
auto compose(Func1 f1, Func2 f2, Funcs... funcs) {
    return [f1, f2, funcs...](auto... args) {
        int result = compose(f2, funcs...)(args...);
        if (result == 0) {  // If a requirement is not satisfied
            return 0;
        }
        return f1(args...) + result;
    };
}
```

In this code, the `compose` function checks the result of the composed functions. If the result is 0, it returns 0 immediately, short-circuiting the rest of the evaluation. Otherwise, it adds the result of `f1(args...)` to the result and returns the sum.

#

Awesome, this works great! I definately would have arrived to this conclussion on my own, but you saved me a few hours for sure, thanks.
